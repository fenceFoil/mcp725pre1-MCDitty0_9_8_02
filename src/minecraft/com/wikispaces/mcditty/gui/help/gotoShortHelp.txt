GoTo [Comment]

Instead of naturally flowing to the next sign, skip to the nearest sign containing the given comment.

Example:

Sign 1: 
"#Tune / A B C"

Sign 2 is a long ways away:
"GoTo Tune"

Wherever Sign 2 is, clicking it will play the nearest #Tune sign. (Note that Minecraft unloads chunks about a hundred blocks from where you are).
