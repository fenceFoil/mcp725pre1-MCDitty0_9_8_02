SFXInst [Inst]
[Tuning] [SFX]

SFXInst replaces the normal sound of a given instrument with a Minecraft sound effect (SFX). The SFX will be made higher or lower and stretched to play notes. Can be removed with SFXInstOff [Inst].

[Inst]: 0 to 127
Instrument to be replaced.

[SFX]: A SFX name.

[Tuning] (Optional): A note (As in B2). At this pitch, the SFX is sounds normal. Some SFX have a default tuning.

Note that if there are multiple sounds for a given SFX (ex: different cat meows), you can specify one in particualar by saying, for example, "meow1" or "meow2", etc.

Note that this keyword tries to activate one 32nd beat BEFORE its location in the ditty to let the SFXInst load.

This keyword may not be immediate: there may be a short pause before the SFX Instrument replaces the normal instrument sound. (Or it may start one note early).

On a positive note, SFX instruments are guaranteed to sound precicely the same for every MCDitty user, even if their MIDI intruments vary in sound or volume.
