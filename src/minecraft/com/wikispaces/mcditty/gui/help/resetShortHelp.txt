Reset:

A reset is a bit like letting a ditty end, and then starting it again at the keyword reset. Reset:

- Lets all the music before the keyword play out,
- Resets all instruments, the tempo, and the current voice and layer
- Restores the key to C major.
- Sets all volumes back to 100

Before letting things afterward start playing again.

Resets are handy for "breaking up" long or complex songs: they're like the ends of tracks, and starting from one is like starting a the beginning of a song.

Resets do not:

- Remove any JFugue-defined words you defined
- Change any X-token settings
- Reset lyric texts or counts
