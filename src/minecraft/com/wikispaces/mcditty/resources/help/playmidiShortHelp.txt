Plays a saved MIDI file. From the /.minecraft/MCDitty/midi/ folder.

The filename should be letters and numbers, with no symbols or spaces. ".mid" is automatically added to the end. Note that currently ".midi" files should be renamed to end with ".mid" if you want to play them with PlayMIDI.

Note that there is no guarantee that the MIDI played will be in sync with the current ditty. There will be a pause before the MIDI begins playing.
