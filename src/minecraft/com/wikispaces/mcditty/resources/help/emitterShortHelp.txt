[Options follow]

Must be on the first line of a sign, and no music or keywords can follow (although comments are allowed).

Emitters create a particle every time a note is played in their ditty. You can customize the particles that it emits and how it emits them with options.

§aTypes:
Note, Heart, Chaos, Dust, Spore, Crit, CritMag, Smoke, Smoke2, Poof, Spark, Splash, RedFume, SnowHit, Slime, Flake, Happy, Angry, Mad

On the lines after, you can specify options:

Options available:
- Voice [0-15] [0-15], etc.
- Rate [1-99]
- Color [0-23]
- Up [-99 to 99]
- Life [1-99]
- Time [1-99]
- Multi [0-5]
- Stream [w, h, q, i, s, t, x, or o]

Options can be abbreviated as well:
- Voice = V
- Rate = R
- Color = C
- Up = U
- Life = L
- Time = T
- Multi = M
- Stream = S

Option descriptions:
- Voice: Particles emit in time with notes from given voices. Can follow with multiple numbers.
- Rate: Max particles may appear at one time, for example in the case of chords.
- Color: The color for note particles.
- Up: How far above the sign to emit particles at. Default 0.
- Life: How many particles to emit before stopping.
- Time: How many quarter-notes to emit for before stopping.
- Multi: Multiplies the number of particles emitted. For example, if Multi is 5, a single note will cause the emitter to emit 5 particles at once. Life is only decreased 1.
- Stream: Emit a continuous stream of particles for the duration of a a note. Follow with the frequency.
